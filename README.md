# Sorting-Algorithms

This repo contains implementations of some classic sorting algorithms written in C++. The three sorting algorithms that are implemented are:
 * Insertion Sort
 * Merge Sort
 * Hybrid Sort (A combination of Merge and Insertion sort)

I implemented the data structure to be sorted as a templated vector from the standard library as to avoid any manual memory management issues.
